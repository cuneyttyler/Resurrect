nexusDescription="[font=Roboto][color=#f1c232][size=5]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color]\n<br />A Restoration spell that will revive NPCs/animals/creatures, but with a more sophisticated result than you'd get from running the \"resurrect\" console command.\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]svdzmg04Yns[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=5]FEATURES[/size][/color]\n<br />\x2022 Scales to your Restoration level: The percentage of health an NPC will resurrect with is directly proportional to your Restoration level, scaling from 0.1% to 100%. Coded to take into account Restoration levels greater than 100 to ensure compatibility with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8889/?]Skyrim Skill Uncapper[/url] or similar mods.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 Preserves the inventory of the target to prevent item duping and maintain immersion. It is recommended to use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/?]Unofficial Patch[/url], since without it NPCs will often drop their equipped weapons upon dying. This spell would then be unable to account for that. See below for examples detailing the inventory behavior.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 Doesn't allow the resurrection of any NPC that you would be unable to cast a reanimation spell at. This tends to include things like: dragons, daedra, dwarven constructs, ghosts, familiars, etc. Spell is safe to cast upon live targets; nothing significant will be able to happen unless the target is dead.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 Will restore your relationship rank level with any resurrected actors of NPC type (usually only humanoids; so not animals or creatures, etc).\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 From my testing, this spell appears to work alright on horses.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 Spell tome is added to spell vendors through script injection, so no bashed patch is necessary.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=5]EXAMPLES[/size][/color]\n<br />\x2022 If you cast this at an NPC with nothing stored inside it, it will resurrect wearing its default outfit only, and in possession of nothing else.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 If you cast this at an NPC with just its default outfit already in its inventory, it will only resurrect wearing that outfit. In addition to these two cases (for NPCs) the target will resurrect in possession of any items it was in possession of when you cast the spell at it.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 If you cast this at a dead chicken, even if you loot the chicken meat from the chicken, it will unfortunately respawn with it again. I think the game classifies that as the chicken's default outfit, so there is no easy solution without SKSE yet. This will probably be true for other animal targets.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=5]VERSIONS[/size][/color]\n<br />\x2022 Main: This is the recommended and default version. Most of the information on this page already describes its behavior.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 Ritual: Spell is a master-level Restoration ritual spell that resurrects in an area of effect centered upon the caster. Spell now requires two hands to cast, and has a longer cast time commensurate with other master-level ritual spells. Magicka cost and tome price have been adjusted accordingly. The spell tome can be purchased from Colette Marence in Winterhold College after completing the Restoration Ritual Spell quest.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=5]NOTES[/size][/color]\n<br />\x2022 You will have to use your discretion when deciding whether or not to cast this spell at your target. You should take into account the fact that the game has scripts that run after a character has died that cannot be undone. For example: A shopkeeper dies. The point comes where the game detects this (sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly) and runs the death script that marks this character as dead to other actors. Usually the shopkeeper's closest family member then takes up the old shopkeeper's job. If you then come along and resurrect that character, don't be surprised when you encounter some strange situations (not necessarily game breaking at all).\n<br />\n<br />Another consequence of this is the character that died can still be referred to as \"dead\" in other parts of the game once you have resurrected it due to the aforementioned scripts having already run, i.e. if you resurrect a character that was supposed to die in a quest, of course the game will behave/refer in a way that reflects that.\n<br />\n<br />For these reasons, I recommend you use this in conjunction with a character protection mod. Better to avoid these important characters dying in the first place so you face less chance of being in a situation where you have to weight the pros and cons over casting this spell.\n<br />\n<br />I would personally recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10297/?]Protect Your People[/url] as it is elegantly implemented and can't be overridden by mod load order since it uses quest aliases to protect the NPCs. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2272/?]Run For Your Lives[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2275/?]When Vampires Attack[/url] are also good ones to have.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022 The leveled list script mentioned above runs through a quest added to the player (not visible in quest log) when loading/starting a game for the first time with this mod activated; it should therefore only run a single time when this quest is first added to the player. Thereafter, since your character will already have the quest that triggers it added and marked complete (again not visible in quest log), the leveled list injector script should never run ever again. The only other script that will run with this mod is the one that is triggered by casting the spell. This mod should therefore be quite performance friendly. As a result of this injection method, the mod can easily be installed on existing saves.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=5]CREDITS[/size][/color]\n<br />Quite heavily inspired by KaptenVit's [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10215/?]Resurrect Dead Spell[/url], but written completely from the ground and with considerable differences.[/font]"
